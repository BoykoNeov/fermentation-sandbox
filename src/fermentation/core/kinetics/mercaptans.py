"""Mercaptans (volatile thiols) — the carbon-bearing autolytic reductive off-aroma (decision D-45).

The second reductive-fault sulfur beat, after the autolytic H₂S source (D-44). Beyond H₂S, the
other "reduction" off-aromas are the **mercaptans** (thiols): methanethiol ("cooked cabbage",
sensory threshold ~2–3 µg/L) and its onion/rubber sibling ethanethiol. Booked as **methanethiol**
(:data:`~fermentation.core.chemistry.M_METHANETHIOL`) — the p-coumaric-for-``hydroxycinnamics``
single-species idiom (D-40).

**THE FALSE LUMP IS RETIRED (decision D-110).** Through D-109 the pool was named ``mercaptans``
and flagged ``lumped``, while every layer of it named methanethiol — the yield (g *methanethiol*
per g biomass, anchored on the MeSH ceiling), the ``total_carbon`` weight, the OAV threshold, the
Stevens exponent, and the precursor draw. Nothing in the model produces ethanethiol or any other
thiol, so the fixed-lump-composition caveat described **a mixture the mass balance did not
contain**: a plural name and a ``lumped=True`` flag asserting an uncertainty the model did not
actually carry. D-110 renamed the pool to ``methanethiol`` and flipped the flag — a **pure
relabel**, verified to move no number (the pool already *was* this molecule at every layer, which
is precisely why the rename could be free). It was the **last** lumped pool in the project: the
``esters`` lump was speciated at D-96, the ``fusels`` lump at D-99, and the D-66
lump-composition risk class closes here.

**A lump flag is a CLAIM, and an over-cautious false one is still false.** The flag read as
honest humility — it looked like the model conceding uncertainty. But it pointed at a mixture that
did not exist, so it bought no safety and cost a real name; a caveat that describes something the
mass balance does not contain is not conservatism, it is **a wrong claim wearing a hedge's
clothes**.

**Formation — autolysis-linked, carbon from methionine (Option A, owner-chosen).** Methanethiol is
released by **methionine degradation** on the lees during self-digestion — one real route among
several (see **SCOPE** below; this docstring no longer claims it is the *chief* one), so — like the
D-44 H₂S source — its rate is a **yield on the shared autolysis flux**
(:func:`~fermentation.core.kinetics.autolysis.autolysis_flux`, ``r = k_autolysis·f_T·X_dead``). But
unlike carbon-free H₂S, **methanethiol carries carbon**, so the Process cannot draw from nothing —
it must debit a tracked carbon pool. It draws that carbon from the ``amino_acids`` pool and
**deaminates** the nitrogen back to ammonium ``N`` — the exact D-33
:class:`~fermentation.core.kinetics.byproducts.FuselAminoAcidReroute` idiom (draw carbon from amino
acids, release their nitrogen to ``N``):

    r_merc      = y_mercaptan · autolysis_flux · [met/(K_met + met)]            [g MeSH/L/h]
    d[mercaptans] = +r_merc
    d[methionine] = −(r_merc · c_merc) / c_met      (methionine mass carrying that carbon)
    d[N]           = +(that methionine mass) · y_N   (DEAMINATION → ammonium)

* **Availability gate** ``met/(K_met + met)``, with ``K_met = K_amino_acids ·
  must_aa_fraction_methionine`` (the D-100 relative-depletion rule): production ramps down smoothly
  to 0 as the pool empties, so the draw can never drive ``methionine`` negative (a solver-safe C¹
  shadow, no hard clamp discontinuity). The pool is kept non-empty by the D-34 autolysis refill,
  which the same flux runs — so mercaptan formation trails the refill.
* **Not flux-linked to fermentation** (first-order in ``X_dead``, via ``autolysis_flux``), so — like
  the D-44 H₂S source — it fires post-dryness and there is no CO₂ stream to strip it: mercaptans
  **accumulate as residual**, the reductive fault copper fining removes.

**THE ARGININE CAVEAT IS RETIRED (D-100), not restated.** D-45 shipped with this Process drawing
its carbon from the lumped ``amino_acids`` pool — booked as *arginine*, a molecule containing **no
sulfur**, which therefore could not possibly make a mercaptan — and carried the mismatch as a
provenance caveat (~0.66 mol N released per mol MeSH against real methionine's ~1). D-100 speciated
the pool, so the draw **is** methionine and the ledger and the chemistry finally name one molecule.

**SCOPE — this Process models ONE of several real MeSH routes, and the hard zero is the tell.**
It is the *autolytic* mercaptan, gated on the D-34 autolysis flux and opt-in, so an autolysis-off
wine reads ``mercaptans = 0``. The wine literature attributes MeSH to at least two further routes
this model does not carry: (1) yeast **demethiolation** of methionine (via transamination to KMBA)
during **active fermentation**, and (2) **post-bottling** formation under anoxic storage from
thioacetates and disulfides. So:

* **Young, non-sur-lie wine — the zero is roughly defensible.** Methanethiol boils at **~6 °C**
  (CH₃SH; contrast ethanethiol's 35 °C), i.e. it is a **gas well below any fermentation
  temperature**, so the fermentation-route thiol is largely **stripped by the CO₂ stream** as it
  forms. That is exactly why this Process is deliberately *not* flux-linked (see above): a
  flux-linked thiol would be swept out, and the reductive fault is a post-dryness, un-stripped
  residual.
* **Bottle-aged wine — the zero is NOT defensible.** Route (2) makes MeSH regardless of lees
  (screwcap reduction is the classic case), and this model cannot show it at all. Closing that gap
  needs a new Process over precursors (thioacetates/disulfides) that are not modelled — a beat of
  its own, **not** a re-anchoring of ``y_mercaptan``.

**Evidence grade, stated because it bounds the above.** The route survey rests on secondary reviews;
the primary sources that would settle which route dominates (Smith 2015, *Aust. J. Grape Wine Res.*
21:S1; Franco-Luesma & Ferreira 2016, *J. Agric. Food Chem.*, on anoxic-storage formation) are
paywalled and **unread**. That grade is enough to stop this docstring claiming MeSH comes *chiefly*
from the lees — it does not say so any more — and enough to record the omission; it is **not**
enough to re-shape the route or re-anchor the yield. The threshold is independently corroborated:
``threshold_mercaptans_wine`` = 3.0 µg/L against a reported wine MeSH threshold of 1.8–3.1 µg/L.

**Conservation — closes on both ledgers by construction (no new conservation code beyond weighting
``mercaptans`` in ``total_carbon``).** Carbon: the carbon into ``mercaptans`` (``r_merc·c_merc``)
equals the carbon out of ``methionine`` (``met_mass·c_met``) — the draw is sized to match. Nitrogen:
all the methionine nitrogen leaving that pool (``met_mass·y_N``) lands in the ``N`` pool
(methanethiol is nitrogen-free), so ``total_nitrogen`` is unchanged. Both to machine precision,
since ``mercaptans`` is weighted in ``total_carbon`` (as methanethiol) and ``methionine``/``N`` are
already on both ledgers (D-32).

**TIER — a new structural drop on ``N`` (the D-27 ``E`` parallel, advisor-flagged).**
:class:`AutolyticMercaptan` is the **first autolysis-gated Process to write ``N``** (via the
deamination). So an autolysis-on run drops the *structural* ``tier_of("N")`` PLAUSIBLE→SPECULATIVE
— even on an autolysis-on / amino-acid-dose-*off* run, where the other N-writer
(:class:`~fermentation.core.kinetics.byproducts.FuselAminoAcidReroute`) stays disabled. The
param-aware tier users see was typically already speculative (growth reads speculative params), so
no headline change, and the ``N`` pool genuinely does carry a speculative deamination trace when
autolysis is opted in. Tier **speculative** overall (the yield magnitude is an author estimate).

**Isolability — opt-in and wine-only, with the D-34 autolysis Processes.** Touches only
``mercaptans``/``amino_acids``/``N`` (all wine slots), so it is wired into wine alone and disabled
**together with** :class:`~fermentation.core.kinetics.autolysis.YeastAutolysis` and
:class:`~fermentation.core.kinetics.hydrogen_sulfide.AutolyticHydrogenSulfide` at the compile seam
absent ``autolysis_rate_per_h`` — an undosed wine run is byte-for-byte the validated core and the
empty ``mercaptans`` slot keeps its tier. Guards: no dead biomass (``autolysis_flux ≤ 0``) or an
empty amino-acid pool ⇒ 0. Copper fining removes it (the ``add_copper`` verb, extended in D-45 to
bind mercaptans as copper mercaptide Cu(SR)₂).

#: closed — the draw was *defined* to close it — which is exactly why no conservation test ever saw

#: (D-105): demethiolation is ``1 mol methionine → 1 mol methanethiol + 1 mol 2-oxobutyrate + NH₃``,
#: an internal contradiction with a 0.2:1 draw that needed no literature to see. D-100's line here —
#: "the D-45 caveat is retired, not restated" — **overclaimed**: the *identity* was retired
#: (arginine
#: → methionine, a real fix), the *stoichiometry* was not. Half a caveat was retired and the
#: sentence
#: claimed all of it.
#:
#: **What unblocked it was not a source but a pool.** D-105 could not patch this: drawing the honest
#: 1 mol would strand four carbons with nowhere to go, because the model had no **2-oxobutyrate**.
#: That is the same molecule sotolon consumes (which D-104 fabricated from sugar via ``de_novo``) —
#: so this route and sotolon were **producer and consumer of one untracked molecule, in the same
#: wine, on the same aging phase**, for two decisions. D-107 builds the pool
#: (:mod:`~fermentation.core.kinetics.keto_acids`), and the draw below is now the honest **1:1**:
#: the C4 goes to ``alpha_ketobutyrate`` and the full nitrogen to ``N``.
#:
#: **It was measured INERT before the fix and it stays nearly so — that is expected, not a
#: disappointment** (D-105): this route only fires *sur lie*, where autolysis refills methionine
#: faster than any consumer draws it (pool 2.74 → 5.88 mg/L over a 150-day aging), so even the
#: corrected 5× draw takes only ~3.6% of the pool and the gate never bites. The value here is that
