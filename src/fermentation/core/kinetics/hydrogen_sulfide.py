"""Hydrogen sulfide (H₂S) — the low-nitrogen sulfidic off-aroma, as a produced-only pool.

The §3.2 aroma beat after the SO₂ free/bound split (decision D-29), and the
**accounting-easiest** metabolite yet: H₂S ("rotten egg", sensory threshold ~1–2 µg/L)
carries no carbon, so — like free SO₂ (D-22) — it sits on *no* conservation ledger and its
production draws from nothing the model tracks (there is no sulfate/sulfur state; the sulfur
is simply released).

**The mechanism (inverse-nitrogen gate).** Yeast reduces sulfate to sulfide via the
sulfate-reduction sequence during fermentation. Normally the sulfide is fixed onto
nitrogen skeletons (O-acetylserine / O-acetylhomoserine) to build cysteine and methionine;
when yeast-assimilable nitrogen (YAN) runs low, there is no nitrogen acceptor for the
sulfide, so it is excreted as H₂S. Production is therefore **de-repressed at low nitrogen** —
the opposite of the Ehrlich fusel gate (which *needs* amino-acid nitrogen, ``N/(K_n+N)``,
D-19). Modelled as the fermentative-flux shape times a decreasing inverse-N gate:

    d(h2s)/dt = k_h2s · X·S_total/(K_sugar_uptake + S_total) · K_h2s_n/(K_h2s_n + N)

* **Flux-linked** (shares ``K_sugar_uptake`` with the uptake Process), so H₂S is made only
  during active fermentation and stops at dryness — the sulfate-reduction machinery runs
  while the cell ferments. This is the :class:`~fermentation.core.kinetics.vicinal_diketones\
  .AcetolactateExcretion` / :class:`~fermentation.core.kinetics.acetaldehyde.\
  AcetaldehydeProduction` producer shape.
* **Inverse-N gate** ``K_h2s_n/(K_h2s_n + N)``: ~0 when N is replete, → 1 as N → 0. Its
  half-saturation ``K_h2s_n`` is a **separate parameter on the YAN scale** (~0.1 g/L), *not*
  the growth ``K_n`` (0.0088 g/L) — reusing the growth constant would make a razor-edge gate
  that only opens in a thin sliver at near-zero N. The YAN-scale constant instead makes the
  gate a smooth, physiologically-relevant repression across the must's nitrogen range
  (H₂S-management practice targets YAN ≳ 140–150 mg/L; Ugliano/Henschke).

**Temperature-flat (v1 simplification), like the excretion / acetaldehyde producers.** Real
H₂S has a strain- and temperature-dependence, but it is not clean or benchmarked, so v1
holds production temperature-independent and documents it. No Arrhenius factor.

**Carbon / conservation — nothing to close.** H₂S is carbon-free (registered with 0 carbon
in :mod:`fermentation.core.chemistry`), so it is absent from ``total_carbon`` and its
production perturbs no carbon/nitrogen/mass balance. The Process **touches only ``h2s``** and
*reads* ``X``/``S``/``N`` from state without writing them, so it is the most isolable beat in
the model: disabling it leaves the **derivative (RHS) of every other state column byte-for-byte
identical** (verified exactly — no other column's contribution changes). The *integrated*
trajectory then differs by only a ~1e-7 relative amount, which is a **pure adaptive-solver mesh
artifact** — adding the ``h2s`` equation shifts the error-controlled step selection, not any
physical pathway. This is cleaner than the acetaldehyde buffer (D-27), whose transient ``E``
dip feeds a *genuine* second-order ``E``→viability perturbation on top of the mesh effect;
here nothing downstream reads ``h2s``, so there is no physical coupling at all.

**Tier — no headline consequence.** The rate constants are order-of-magnitude estimates, so
the Process is **speculative** and parameter-tier propagation (D-1) caps the ``h2s`` output
tier at speculative. Unlike the diacetyl decarboxylation (which writes the shared ``CO2``
slot, D-26) and the acetaldehyde production (which writes ``E``, D-27), this Process writes a
**fresh pool nothing else reads**, so *no other column's* structural tier drops.

**Scope / honest caveats.**

* **Residual vs cumulative (D-42).** The CO₂-stripping sink
  (:class:`HydrogenSulfideVolatilization`, decision D-42) now sweeps most H₂S out with the CO₂
  stream, so the ``h2s`` pool is the *residual* (dissolved, µg/L) H₂S reality shows, and
  ``h2s + h2s_gas`` is cumulative produced (the ester D-19 produced-only → D-20/D-21 Henry's-law
  sink precedent, but carbon-free). Dropping *just* the sink recovers this module's original
  D-29 produced-only ``h2s`` pool byte-for-byte (``h2s_gas`` stays 0).
* **Autolytic (sur-lie reduction) H₂S — now modelled (decision D-44).**
  :class:`AutolyticHydrogenSulfide` is a *second* producer feeding the same ``h2s`` pool, but from
  yeast **autolysis** rather than fermentative sulfate reduction: as dead cells self-digest they
  release intracellular sulfide, a **yield on the autolysis flux** ``d(h2s) = y_h2s_autolysis ·
  (k_autolysis·f_T·X_dead)`` (the D-33 :class:`~fermentation.core.kinetics.byproducts.\
  FuselAminoAcidReroute` recompute-the-producer's-rate idiom, so a sur-lie timescale sweep keeps
  peptide *and* sulfide release on one clock). The headline that makes this the *reductive*-fault
  H₂S: it is **not flux-linked**, so the CO₂-stripping sink (which gates off at dryness with the
  fermentative flux) cannot sweep it — post-dryness autolytic H₂S **accumulates as residual**,
  exactly the "reduction" that develops on the lees and needs racking / aeration / **copper**. It
  is opt-in and wine-only, riding the D-34 ``autolysis_rate_per_h`` gate (an undosed wine run is
  byte-for-byte the validated core). NB it fires whenever ``X_dead > 0`` *and* autolysis is on —
  including late AF (``X_dead`` accumulates during AF via D-13 inactivation), where the sink *does*
  still strip it; the "persists un-stripped" character is **emergent post-dryness only**.
* **Copper fining — now a removal lever (decision D-44).** The ``add_copper`` intervention
  (``fermentation.scenario.compile``) binds dissolved H₂S as insoluble copper sulfide (Cu²⁺ + H₂S
  → CuS↓, 1:1 mol) and removes it from the ``h2s`` pool — the standard remediation for the
  autolytic reduction above. Carbon-free, so (like ``add_so2``) the removal perturbs no elemental
  ledger. Residual copper (excess Cu left in the wine) and copper binding of *mercaptans* are out
  of scope in v1 (the mercaptan pool is deferred; see below).
* **The cross-must YAN lever is muted by an upstream model gap.** The defining real behaviour
  — a low-YAN must makes far more H₂S than a high-YAN one — is only *partially* reproduced,
  because the nitrogen model strips ``N`` to ~0 early (by ~day 1.3) *regardless of dose* (no
  residual-N/proline floor). Once N = 0 the inverse gate is ~1 for the rest of the ferment
  for **every** must, so cumulative H₂S differs little between a low- and high-YAN must. What
  *does* emerge cleanly and is the acceptance anchor: **within a run, the H₂S production rate
  ramps up as N depletes** — the gate mechanism itself. The cross-must lever becomes real only
  once the deferred residual-N floor lands (see decision D-29 and the D-23 nitrogen-gap note).
* **Mercaptans (thiols) still out of scope.** Copper also binds mercaptans (methanethiol /
  ethanethiol), the other reductive off-aromas; unlike H₂S these carry carbon (so a ``mercaptans``
  pool would sit on ``total_carbon``), and their formation is genuinely murky (methionine
  degradation / autolysis, not a clean H₂S → thiol step). A mercaptan pool + copper-binds-thiols is
  deferred pending a scope decision (decision D-44).

    shows — which is exactly the D-29 produced-only overstatement this beat lifts.

    * ``f_gas(T) = arrhenius_factor(T, E_a_uptake, T_ref)`` — the **gas-flow** factor: the
      stripping rides the evolving-CO₂ stream, whose rate is the fermentative uptake flux scaled
      by the *same* ``E_a_uptake`` the uptake Process carries (the ester precedent).
    * ``f_part(T) = arrhenius_factor(T, dH_h2s_volatil, T_ref)`` — the **gas/liquid partition**
      (van't Hoff) factor for the H₂S Henry's-law constant, which *rises* with temperature
      (H₂S dissolution is exothermic ⇒ warmer ⇒ more volatile). ``dH_h2s_volatil`` ≈ 17.5 kJ/mol
      is the **sourced** partition enthalpy (Sander Henry's-law compilation, −d ln kH/d(1/T)
      ≈ 2100 K), a physical Q10 ≈ 1.3 — weaker than the ester's +45 kJ/mol, *not* a fitted lever.

    **First-order in the dissolved H₂S present, and stops when fermentation stops** (``flux → 0``

    production is likewise flux-linked; the problematic post-fermentation / autolytic H₂S that
    persists *because* no CO₂ sweeps it is out of scope, like the ester sink's omission of slow
    passive evaporation after the cap goes on). Because both production and stripping share the
    flux, the **residual quasi-steady-state ``h2s_ss = k_h2s·gate / (k_h2s_volatil·f_gas·f_part)``
    has the flux cancel** — residual H₂S tracks the inverse-N gate and temperature, not the
    ferment speed: it **rises as ``N`` depletes** (the gate opens) then **freezes at dryness**
    (both terms gate off together). An emergent, honestly-flagged artifact: production is held
    temperature-flat (D-29) while stripping rises with T, so the model predicts *residual H₂S
    falls with a warmer ferment* — physically reasonable (warm ferments purge sulfide) but
    **unbenchmarked**, and reality is mixed (warmth also raises production / N-demand, held flat

    construction** (no closure test needed; the invariant is ``h2s + h2s_gas`` unchanged from the
    sink-off produced pool). ``h2s`` is clamped ≥ 0 so a solver undershoot cannot strip a negative
    pool into spurious gas. Tier **plausible** in form (CO₂-stripping by the evolving gas is
