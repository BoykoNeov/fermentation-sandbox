"""Excreted keto-acid overflow pools — the non-acetaldehyde SO₂-binding carbonyls (D-49, D-50).

Acetaldehyde is the *principal* SO₂-binder in wine, but it is not the only one: yeast
excretes **overflow keto-acids** — pyruvate (D-49) and α-ketoglutarate (D-50) — during active
fermentation, and those persist in the finished wine (10s–100s mg/L) as real, measured
SO₂-binding carbonyls (Jackowetz & Mira de Orduña 2013; Burroughs & Sparks 1973). Both are built
as **excreted side pools** with the SAME structure, so the free/bound-SO₂ split (D-28) and the
acetaldehyde protection (D-47) can share SO₂ across *all* the carbonyls that really compete for
it (the D-51 multi-carbonyl binding, still to come).

**Why a side pool, not an on-pathway intermediate (the load-bearing modelling choice, D-49).**
The tempting "faithful" model — route acetaldehyde's carbon *through* pyruvate (its real
metabolic precursor: pyruvate → acetaldehyde + CO₂ → ethanol) — was designed and **rejected**.
It conflates two physically distinct pools: acetaldehyde's precursor is the *intracellular*
flux intermediate (enormous flux, vanishing pool, never persists, never measured), whereas
the SO₂-binding pyruvate is the *extracellular* excreted overflow residual (small flux,
persistent, measured). One pool cannot be both, and the persistence mechanism the rework
needed — "SO₂ protects pyruvate from pyruvate decarboxylase" — is not real: pyruvate
decarboxylase is intracellular, the excreted residual never meets it. Worse, that shielding
would make dosed SO₂ *sequester acetaldehyde's precursor* and **suppress** acetaldehyde — the
exact opposite of the SO₂-induced over-production the model just shipped (D-48). So the
excreted-overflow side pool is the *more* faithful structure for the quantity that matters
here, and acetaldehyde / D-27 / D-47 / D-48 stay untouched.

**Carbon — drawn from sugar, returned to ethanol + CO₂ (closing on the existing ledger).**
Following the D-19/D-26 byproduct idiom:

* :class:`PyruvateExcretion` draws pyruvate's carbon *out of ``S``* (via
  :func:`~fermentation.core.kinetics.carbon_routing.draw_carbon_from_sugar`, booked at the C3
  pyruvate fraction) while the yeast ferments — flux-linked, so it stops at dryness, leaving a
  full overflow pool.
* :class:`PyruvateReassimilation` returns it: pyruvate re-enters metabolism and is oxidised to
  ethanol + CO₂ (``C3 → C2 + C1``, one mole each — carbon-closing on the ledger exactly like
  malic → lactic + CO₂, D-23). **Flux-linked (co-metabolic)**, sharing excretion's
  ``X·S/(K_sugar_uptake+S)`` shape, so it clears pyruvate while the yeast ferments and **stops at
  dryness** — which *freezes* the pool at its dryness value as a **persistent finished-wine
  residual** for SO₂ to bind. This is deliberately the *opposite* of the acetaldehyde-reduction
  template (D-27, no-flux, viable-``X``-gated, runs through the post-ferment rest): ADH keeps
  reducing acetaldehyde after sugar is gone, but a normal ferment finishes with the yeast still
  viable, so a no-flux gate would drain overflow pyruvate to ~0 over the long tail — a
  crash-dependent residual a clean ferment never strands. Co-metabolic flux-linking pegs the
  residual to *end-of-fermentation*, not yeast death, so it is crash- and duration-independent
  (decision D-49, option A). Held temperature-flat (a documented v1 simplification, like the
  acetaldehyde production and α-acetolactate excretion).

Because both terms ride the same flux shape, the pool rises monotonically to the quasi-steady
plateau ``k_pyruvate_excretion / k_pyruvate_reassimilation`` and freezes there — a v1
simplification that drops the real mid-ferment *peak-then-decline* transient (overflow pyruvate's
exponential-growth excretion). Nothing reads the peak; D-51 reads only the residual, so the growth-
coupled excretion that would restore the transient (option B) is deferred. Re-assimilation returns
carbon to ``E``/``CO2`` (not ``S``) because that is pyruvate's real metabolic fate (forward to
ethanol, not back to sugar) — and a refund-to-sugar would be a no-op at post-dryness ``S = 0``
anyway. ``total_carbon`` (which weights ``pyruvate`` at its own C3 fraction) closes to **machine
precision** through the whole excrete-then-reassimilate course; ``total_mass`` carries the usual
small gap (the oxidation moves untracked NAD(P)H / O) — carbon is the invariant, as for the
diacetyl rest (D-26) and the acetaldehyde buffer (D-27).

**Isolability (prime directive #3).** The pool lives in its own ``_KETO_ACID_PROCESSES`` tuple
(:mod:`fermentation.core.media`) and is **wine-only** (v1): the SO₂-binding competition it
exists for is a wine readout, and no §2.2 beer benchmark asserts a keto-acid level — beer
overflow pyruvate is deferred. A ProcessSet built without it is the prior core. Unlike the
byte-for-byte-isolable acetaldehyde buffer, excretion touches ``S`` and re-assimilation touches
``E``/``CO2``, so the pool routes a genuine (small) slice of sugar carbon on a detour to
ethanol; the endpoint difference from the pool-off core is only the **stranded residual** (a
few tens of mg/L of sugar carbon parked as pyruvate rather than fermented on to ethanol), which
is ≪ 0.1 % of ABV — the §2.2 CO₂/ABV/realised-yield benchmarks are preserved far below any
tolerance (verified at endpoint, not just transiently).

**Tiers.** Both rate constants are order-of-magnitude estimates, so both Processes are
**speculative**; parameter-tier propagation (D-1) caps the ``pyruvate`` output tier at
speculative regardless. The excreted-overflow *mechanism* (yeast excretes pyruvate during
active fermentation, re-assimilating it late) is textbook; only the RATE magnitudes are the
author's estimates, tuned so the pool peaks in the real ~100s mg/L range and settles to a
~10–40 mg/L finished-wine residual.

**α-Ketoglutarate (decision D-50) — same structure, ONE load-bearing difference in the carbon
split.** :class:`AlphaKetoglutarateExcretion` / :class:`AlphaKetoglutarateReassimilation` mirror
the pyruvate pair exactly (flux-linked excretion draws C5 out of ``S``; flux-linked co-metabolic
reassimilation returns it, stopping at dryness to freeze a persistent residual). Pyruvate's
reassimilation happens to route ``C3 → C2(ethanol) + C1(CO2)`` mole-for-mole — which is *exactly*
the Gay-Lussac fermentation carbon ratio (2 ethanol-carbon : 1 CO2-carbon), so the detour is
stoichiometrically indistinguishable from the main pathway and the pool-on/off ABV/CO₂ delta is
only the frozen residual (rel ~4e-5, D-49). Naively copying that as "1 mole ethanol + 1 mole
CO2 per mole substrate" for a C5 species would instead route a CO2-heavy 1+4 split, permanently
diverting reassimilation *throughput* (not just the residual — throughput is ~10–20× the residual,
since the pool cycles many times over the ferment) away from ethanol into CO2, which would blow
past the §2.2 ABV/CO₂ tolerance. So α-KG's reassimilation returns carbon **at the same 2:1
Gay-Lussac ratio**: ``5/3`` mol ethanol + ``5/3`` mol CO2 per mole of α-KG consumed
(``C5 → C(10/3)`` ethanol-carbon + ``C(5/3)`` CO2-carbon — carbon-exact, and reduces to
pyruvate's mole-for-mole case when the carbon count is 3). Neither destination (ethanol/CO2
here, vs. a tempting succinate/Byp route via the *real* α-KG-dehydrogenase reaction) is more
"biochemically true": α-KG dehydrogenase is largely repressed under the anaerobic conditions
that make α-KG overflow in the first place, and the actual dominant reassimilation fate is the
N-coupled glutamate synthesis route (not modelled in v1) — so both are lumped carbon-closing
stand-ins (the fusel/ester idiom, D-19), and the ethanol/CO2 route is chosen here because it
preserves isolability, matching pyruvate exactly.
Residual sized *lower* than pyruvate's ~30 mg/L (nominal ~20 mg/L): α-ketoglutarate is typically
somewhat less abundant in finished wine than pyruvate (Jackowetz & Mira de Orduña 2013).

**α-Ketobutyrate (decision D-107) — THE NODE: the first excreted keto-acid with a CONSUMER.**
:class:`AlphaKetobutyrateExcretion` / :class:`AlphaKetobutyrateReassimilation` are the third pair,
and the reassimilation is *literally* α-KG's code at ``carbon_atoms = 4`` (the Gay-Lussac split was
already written generically — D-50 paid that cost once). The **excretion is the new shape**, and two
things make this pool different in kind from its two siblings:

1. **It is consumed.** Pyruvate and α-KG are terminal residuals that exist to bind SO₂ (D-51).
   α-Ketobutyrate is the **C4 half of sotolon's aldol** (Pham *et al.* 1995;
   :class:`~fermentation.core.kinetics.aging.SotolonAldolCondensation`) — so this pool is not a
   parking space, it is a *substrate*, and its frozen dryness residual is what the bottle-aging
   aldol eats over the following years.
2. **It has a second producer.** The D-45 mercaptan route
   (:class:`~fermentation.core.kinetics.mercaptans.AutolyticMercaptan`) is
   ``methionine → methanethiol + 2-oxobutyrate + NH₃``, and until this slot existed the
   2-oxobutyrate had nowhere to go — which is precisely why that route drew methionine at **0.2 mol
   per mol thiol** (a 5× under-draw, D-105) rather than the honest 1. The producer and the consumer
   were **both already in the tree, on opposite sides of one untracked molecule**, for two decisions
   before anything connected them.

**Why the carbon source SPLITS, and why the rate does not (the load-bearing shape).** Crépin *et
al.*
2017 measures 2-ketobutyrate's source as intracellular threonine that is **19% consumed (exogenous)
threonine and 81% newly synthesised** — i.e. de-novo-dominated. So excretion draws its carbon
``gate : (1−gate)`` between the must ``threonine`` pool and the sugar de-novo stand-in (D-19 option
a1), with ``gate`` threonine's own D-100 relative-depletion gate; the threonine share is a genuine
**deamination** (``L-threonine → 2-oxobutanoate + NH₃``, ILV1), so its nitrogen goes to ``N``, while
the de-novo share carries none (sugar has no nitrogen — the physical point). The **rate** is
flux-only ``k · X · S/(K+S)``, exactly its two siblings': gating the rate on threonine would empty
the pool in a threonine-free wine and kill sotolon — the D-104 canary, one pool further upstream.
This is D-104's structure with the gate finally on **the molecule it was always about**: D-104 split
sotolon's carbon on threonine's gate at *consumption* time, standing in for a keto-acid pool it did
not have. The enrichment is now fixed where reality fixes it — at **synthesis** — and every consumer
of the pool inherits one enrichment, which is Crépin's own signature ("the isotopic enrichment
detected in propanol … was the same as that measured in proteinogenic threonine").

**Isolability, and the reason it is exact.** The pool joins the same wine-only
``_KETO_ACID_PROCESSES``
tuple. Its consumer's rate is **bilinear in this pool and acetaldehyde**, so a ProcessSet built
without these Processes leaves ``alpha_ketobutyrate`` at 0 and sotolon's rate at *exactly* 0 — no
clamp, no gate, no epsilon. That is not a happy accident: it is why
:class:`~fermentation.core.kinetics.aging.SotolonAldolCondensation` is written mass-action rather
than gated (D-107).

    """Overflow-α-ketobutyrate excretion — fills the keto-acid NODE (decision D-107).

    ``d(alpha_ketobutyrate)/dt = k_alpha_kb_excretion · X · S_total/(K_sugar_uptake + S_total)``.
    The **rate** is flux-only, exactly like its two siblings; the **carbon source** is the one new
    shape in this module, and it splits::

        gate      = threonine's D-100 relative-depletion gate
        carbon    = rate · c(alpha_ketobutyrate)
        threonine share: gate · carbon      → drawn from `threonine`, its N deaminated to `N`
        de-novo share:   (1−gate) · carbon  → drawn from `S` (the sugar stand-in), N-free

    **Why split, and why not gate the rate.** Crépin *et al.* 2017 measures 2-ketobutyrate as **19%
    exogenous threonine / 81% newly synthesised**, so a pure-threonine draw would be wrong by ~5×
    *and* would make a threonine-free wine produce no sotolon — the D-104 canary. A pure-sugar draw
    would be simpler and would zero the enrichment, throwing away the one thing D-104 got right. The
    split reproduces the 19/81 rather than asserting it: it is ``gate``, the same quantity the
    Ehrlich re-route gives propanol off the same pool, which is Crépin's own signature (one
    intracellular pool ⇒ one enrichment, seen identically by every consumer).

    **The nitrogen is not decoration.** ``L-threonine → 2-oxobutanoate + NH₃`` (ILV1) is a genuine
    deamination and α-ketobutyrate is nitrogen-free, so *all* the drawn threonine's nitrogen lands
    in
    ``N`` — which is what closes ``total_nitrogen``. The de-novo share releases none, because sugar
    has none; that asymmetry is the physical content of the split, not a bookkeeping artifact.

    Held temperature-flat (v1, the D-49/D-50 call). Touches ``alpha_ketobutyrate``/``threonine``/
    ``S``/``N``. **Writes ``N``**, so an enabled run drops structural ``tier_of("N")``
    PLAUSIBLE→SPECULATIVE (the D-45 precedent). Tier **speculative** (rate magnitude estimate).

    **The freeze is what the consumer needs.** As with pyruvate/α-KG this is flux-linked, so it

    at dryness and the pool holds its quasi-steady plateau
