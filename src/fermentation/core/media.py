"""Medium definitions — the named state layouts the validated core models.

A *medium* (wine, beer, …) fixes two things the rest of the engine builds on:

  * its :class:`~fermentation.core.state.StateSchema` — how many sugar slots, in
    what order, alongside biomass / ethanol / nitrogen / temperature / CO2; and
  * the Processes that act on that state (the kinetics).

Both are data here, not physics. This module declares *what a wine or beer state
looks like* and *which Processes apply*; the Processes themselves are ordinary
:class:`~fermentation.core.process.Process` subclasses elsewhere in the core, and
the industry-unit conversion boundary lives in ``fermentation.scenario.compile``.
Keeping the layout in the core gives the Processes (which reference variable names
like ``"S"`` and ``"N"``) and the scenario→core compile seam a single source of
truth to agree on.

The shared variables (decisions D-B / D-4):

    X      viable biomass        g/L (dry cell weight)
    S      sugar                 g/L — a *vector*: 1 slot for wine, 3 for beer
    E      ethanol               g/L
    N      yeast-assimilable N   g/L
    T      temperature           K
    CO2    evolved CO2           g/L
    X_dead ethanol-inactivated   g/L (non-viable biomass; carbon/nitrogen still
                                 counted, but no longer catalytic — decision D-13)

Sugar is always a vector so beer's sequential glucose → maltose → maltotriose
uptake needs no structural change to also support wine's single lumped sugar.
